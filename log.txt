Converting MixGauss.m file:
	- solved the problem of converting from matrix to array
		- used squeeze(asarray(x))
	- current problems with appending matrices
		- one suggestion is to use c_ and r_ but is not encouraged
		- looking into append
	- also the empty matrix X
		- because when I currently append Xi to it, it keeps the zeros in the 
		X matrix and then puts Xi
	- should run the two for loops and then check what Xi is holding
	- one idea would be to create a temporary matrix which holds the Xi from the
	first run of for loop, then append the next Xi created to it. 

Now will create a github repo from the current folder.

Github is setup

- Using concatenate now
	- concatenates two predefined matrices
	- should find how to concatenate an empty matrix to a new matrix
	- also should find how to create an empty matrix without mentioning its size
	beforehand

Tried with removing X from the loop and just concatenated Xi with Xi.

Seems to be working for now.

Should check the values with matlab values.

Checked the corresponding values, for eg. the array at position 0 and pos 100.
Turns out they are same. Should create something to hold the old values.

Trying to reference the index from 0 to 99 for the first set of Xi, then for the
second set will reference 100 to 199.

Was able to solve the problem of appending X. Had to declare as empty lists 
first. -> Then when the list was done with two arrays, had to convert it into 
an array. 

There is a still a problem of an array containing two independent arrays, which
gives the shape like(2, 100, 2) instead of (200, 2). 
	- For now I'm not able to solve this problem.

Proceeded with plotting the data.
	- In the first try it got plotted, but the scatter plot seemed too 
	classified already. There were two distinct groups of data instead of some
	mixed data like in matlab.
	- Tried to run it again, but now there's some error. Should check if I made
	any changes by mistake. Or should restart the kernel.
	- I remember I tried to remove the array(X). After that it's messed up now.

Solved last problem by using X = concatenate(X, axis=0)
