Converting MixGauss.m file:
	- solved the problem of converting from matrix to array
		- used squeeze(asarray(x))
	- current problems with appending matrices
		- one suggestion is to use c_ and r_ but is not encouraged
		- looking into append
	- also the empty matrix X
		- because when i currently append Xi to it, it keeps the zeros in the 
		X matrix and then puts Xi
	- should run the two for loops and then check what Xi is holding
	- one idea would be to create a temporary matrix which holds the Xi from the
	first run of for loop, then append the next Xi created to it. 

Now will create a github repo from the current folder.
