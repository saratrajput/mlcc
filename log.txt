Converting MixGauss.m file:
	- solved the problem of converting from matrix to array
		- used squeeze(asarray(x))
	- current problems with appending matrices
		- one suggestion is to use c_ and r_ but is not encouraged
		- looking into append
	- also the empty matrix X
		- because when I currently append Xi to it, it keeps the zeros in the 
		X matrix and then puts Xi
	- should run the two for loops and then check what Xi is holding
	- one idea would be to create a temporary matrix which holds the Xi from the
	first run of for loop, then append the next Xi created to it. 

Now will create a github repo from the current folder.

Github is setup

- Using concatenate now
	- concatenates two predefined matrices
	- should find how to concatenate an empty matrix to a new matrix
	- also should find how to create an empty matrix without mentioning its size
	beforehand

Tried with removing X from the loop and just concatenated Xi with Xi.

Seems to be working for now.

Should check the values with matlab values.

Checked the corresponding values, for eg. the array at position 0 and pos 100.
Turns out they are same. Should create something to hold the old values.

Trying to reference the index from 0 to 99 for the first set of Xi, then for the
second set will reference 100 to 199.
